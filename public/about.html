<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Mahmoud, a first‑year computer science student and aspiring full‑stack developer. 
  I’ve just wrapped up learning HTML and am now diving into CSS as I continue building my web development skills. 
  This portfolio is where I’ll share my progress, projects, and the journey of becoming a developer.</p>
